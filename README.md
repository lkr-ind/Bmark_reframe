# Bmark_reframe

This repository contains the reframe code to run the the three benchmark codes for Leicester namely: Ramses, Sphng and Trove.

At present, the build step is separate and is not integrated with the Reframe. For building codes, we can use either Spack and its associated settings file or the normal build process using make.

We are currently including the executables in this repository.
